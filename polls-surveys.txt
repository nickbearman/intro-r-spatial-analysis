Session 2: Recap Quiz

Which is better?
The Mercator projection
The Gall-Peters projection
The Polar projection
None are best, it depends what you are trying to show on the map

What is most important to remember when performing an attribute join?
There must be the same number of columns in both data sets
The attributes must be similar
The attributes must be exactly the same
The data must be in the same language

What do we need to remember when looking at a map:
The map is the best representation of the data
We need to critically analyse the map to see whether it is representing the data fairly
QGIS will only allow us to create the best choropleth map
There is no way to misrepresent spatial data

What coordinate system are these coordinates likely to be in? 
52°N 37’ 30.32’’ 1°E 14’ 2.05’’
British National Grid (Eastings & Northings) EPSG = 27700
UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) Zone 37 N EPSG = 32630
Latitude and Longitude (WGS 1984) EPSG = 4326
