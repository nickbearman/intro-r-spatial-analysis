# Introduction to Spatial Data & Using R as a GIS
This is the material for my 1 day course on **Introduction to Spatial Data & Using R as a GIS**. More details on my courses are available at http://www.geospatialtrainingsolutions.co.uk. 

This course does not spend much time on the very basics of using R - if you want to find out more, there are some good tutorials at http://www.social-statistics.org/?p=764 or http://rpubs.com/nickbearman/gettingstartedwithr. 

The material for this workshop is available here:  
- [The PDF of the handout with the practical instructions (PDF, 4.4 MB)](https://github.com/nickbearman/intro-r-spatial-analysis/blob/master/workbook.pdf)  
- [Software requirements](https://github.com/nickbearman/intro-r-spatial-analysis/blob/master/software-requirements.txt)  
<!-- 
- [The R Glossary and Helpsheet (PDF, 122 KB)](https://github.com/nickbearman/intro-r-spatial-analysis/releases/download/8.3/glossary-helpsheet.pdf)
-->
- [The data used in the workshop (folder, total: 8.1 MB)](https://github.com/nickbearman/intro-r-spatial-analysis/tree/master/data)  

This practical was written using R 3.5.1 (2018-07-02) and RStudio 1.1.463 by Dr. Nick Bearman ([nick@geospatialtrainingsolutions.co.uk](mailto:nick@geospatialtrainingsolutions.co.uk)).
